# DataCollectionFormWe have used 
Data collection Forms are the Forms that are used at the individual and cooperate level to collect data from the public. Here we have tried to create such a Data Collection Form which Fully Dynamic and can generate different types of questions according to users requirements. Impletation details are as follows:

1. We used Java Swing to develop the front-end GUI. 
2. We have created two frames so that one is used to make a form and another can be used to share the created form with the other users. 
3. we have used a XAMPP server, which is an open source cross platform web server solution pack.
4. Inside the php scripts for transaction with the database we have created a Short Language Query from the data received, which when fired does its appropriate task with the database provided by the XAMPP server.

Attaching the whole project implementation readme file and pdf with this description to help you compile and run the code efficiently on you machine :-
